# Ruby Leetcode Solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions for challenges/problems on Leetcode.

All files here are distributed for free, however I ask that these solutions are not copy-pasted to leetcode to inflate your own scores.

This repository is distributed without warranty. Not all of these solutions are extremely optimized, and therefore might not get you an incredible score anyway.

## Languages

Eventually, this repository will also house solutions in other languages, and I wll do a better job of organizing all the files.

## Thought process and full solutions

I take notes on all my solutions in markdown, stored in my private [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/). If you are a recruiter, employer, or even just another fellow hobbyist/developer and you are interested in the full thought-process and notes for my solutions, then please reach out to me and I will be glad to provide any relevant notes I can.
